## Dependencies

This Python code depends on numpy and scipy librairies


## Usage example
Please run the example code as following:
```
python3 example_run.py
```

Output: It will print Accuracy and F1 Measure on Training and Test Data. Also, Multiview C-Bound value on
Training Data after each iteration of algorithm.
